### AWS Migration Strategies

Guides workload migration to AWS, optimizing speed, cost, and complexity.

- **Rehost**: Move workloads as-is to AWS (e.g., via [[AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)]]).
- **Replatform**: Migrate with optimizations (e.g., use [[Amazon RDS]]).
- **Refactor**: Rebuild for cloud-native (e.g., target [[Amazon Aurora]]).
- **Repurchase**: Switch to AWS solutions (e.g., [[Amazon QuickSight]]).
- **Retire**: Eliminate obsolete workloads.
- **Retain**: Keep workloads on-premises for now.
- **Relocate**: Transfer entire environments (e.g., to [[AWS Outposts]]).
