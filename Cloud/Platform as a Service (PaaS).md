#Concept 
### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Cloud computing model providing a managed platform for developing, deploying, and running applications without handling underlying infrastructure. AWS PaaS services like Elastic Beanstalk and App Runner automate server management, patching, and scaling, allowing developers to focus on code and application logic.

### Related Services

- [[AWS Elastic Beanstalk]]: Deploys and manages web applications with minimal infrastructure setup.
- [[AWS App Runner]]: Simplifies containerized application deployment and scaling.
- [[Amazon RDS]]: Manages relational databases, automating backups and patching.
- [[AWS Lambda]]: Runs serverless code for event-driven applications.
- [[Amazon API Gateway]]: Creates and manages APIs for PaaS applications.

### Related Concepts

- Application Development: Simplifies coding by abstracting infrastructure management.
- Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts resources based on application demand.
- Shared Responsibility Model: AWS manages platform infrastructure; customers manage application code and data.
- Serverless: Some PaaS offerings (e.g., Lambda) eliminate server management entirely.
