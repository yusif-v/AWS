### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Cloud computing model providing virtualized compute, storage, and networking resources over the internet. AWS delivers IaaS through services like EC2, allowing customers to rent infrastructure, manage operating systems, and deploy applications with flexibility and scalability, while AWS handles physical hardware and virtualization.
